## Opens urls
Small simple program to configure a list of urls that you want to be opened at a click of a button

To make it into an .exe file i use pyinstaller
``` pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile open_urls.py ```


Recommended to store the .exe file inside a folder, as a config.yaml file will be created once you add URLs.
Then simply make a shortcut to the .exe file and drag it to your desktop or wherever you want it.
